# RNN_Gain_Modulation_1
My version of Lyndon Duong's "Frame_Whitening" Repository. With fixed synaptic weights, this algorithm learns interneuron gains to statistically whiten outputs.

To perform whitening of inputs with random covariance, cd into "Gain_Modulation", and run "whiten.py". Visualize by running "visualize.py" in the same directory, and a plot showing the gains, variances of interneurons, and error in the whitening objective will show.
